## Introduction

This is one of my earlier projects, so it's a very simple static page. 
To develop a habit of studying effectively I started to use the Pomodoro technique. This led to me creating a Pomodoro website to practice the new skills I was learning.
Click on START POMODORO to start the countdown timer from 25 minutes down to zero. A small tomato will appear.

For every 10 minutes that pass, the tomato will grow bigger in size.

An alarm will sound at the end and the background color will turn green, signaling the end of the Pomodoro session and the start of the break.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Lessons learned
I learned how to work with numbers and conditionals in JavaScript to keep track of the time. I used the setInterval() method to make the clock tick down. A lot of the concepts were new to me, so I also got a lot of practice in Googling for answers to my questions about how to implement something and what methods are available to me.

## Improvements
- [ ] Add a timer for a break
- [ ] Style the button better so that it's clear that it's interactive
- [ ] Add a restart button and pause or stop button to the timer
- [ ] Choose your own alarm
- [ ] Choose length of Pomodoro and break
- [ ] Have relaxing videos play during break time
- [ ] Collect a tomato for each Pomodoro session
- [ ] Add an animation to the growth of the tomato
- [ ] At the moment, clicking START POMODORO again after clicking it the first time will make the timer run faster and unevenly. Should disable the button after clicking to prevent this.
